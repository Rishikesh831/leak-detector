📦 Leak Detector — Intelligent SaaS Revenue Leak Detection System

Revenue for SaaS should flow like water through a clean pipeline.
Reality: it leaks everywhere — failed payments, refunds, billing bugs, duplicate invoices, etc.

This system detects revenue anomalies using ML, explains why they occurred, and helps teams fix them quickly.

🚀 Problem Statement

SaaS companies lose revenue silently due to unnoticed billing anomalies.
This system acts as a leak detector, scanning financial flows and highlighting issues instantly so finance and operations can take corrective action.

ML-based anomaly detection (pyOD + custom rules)

SHAP-based explainability for every flagged invoice
